git assisant (gass) is simple tool for quick execution of short scenarios
with git instuctions (and any other CLI instructions). All these scenarios
can be found (and also edited) in the yaml file in the same folder (gass.yaml).
These scenarios can be adjusted and may have additional optiions (e.g. to set
commit-messages or remote-branch names).

To run scenario just execute gass with the scenario name.
>>gass <scenario-name>

Also, you can view list of options with help command
>>gass --help (or -h as shortcut)
